# Pewlett-Hackard Retirement Eligbility

## Overview
Pewlett-Hackard is faces an upcoming challenge due to its aging workforce. The company will need a strategic plan for the upcoming transition as large numbers of senior, experienced employees will likely leave in a short period of time. The current analysis begins to assess the scope of the issue, identifying these employees and which positions within the company are going to be most affected. 
Next, employee information is provided for individuals who may be candidates for a proposed mentorship program, working with retiring employees to prepare for taking on those positions. 

## Results
- The most recent titles for employees who are soon retirement eligible age are most likely to be Senior Engineer and Senior Staff.


- Two managers are in this age bracket. These roles will likely be the most important to fill, but will also require an inividualized approach to identifying potential replacements. 

- There were 1549 individuals identified as eligible for the proposed mentorship program.

- The total number of individuals included in the table for retirement by title is 133776. This number does not make sense given our earlier analysis identified only 33,118 current employees at retirement age.
